The [IBM Cloud Push Notifications service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/push-notifications) provides a unified push service to send real-time notifications to mobile and web applications. The Swift server-side SDK for sending push notifications through the IBM Cloud Push Notifications services.

Ensure that you go through [IBM Cloud Push Notifications service documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/mobilepush?topic=mobile-pushnotification-gettingstartedtemplate#gettingstartedtemplate) before you start.

## Installation

#### Swift Package Manager

```swift
import PackageDescription
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bluemix-pushnotifications-swift-sdk.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.6.0"))
	]
)
```

#### Build on Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get update // not required on Mac
swift build -Xcc -fblocks -Xlinker -rpath -Xlinker $(pwd)/.build/debug/
```

## Authentication
In order to use an IBM Push Notifications service in a your application, you will need to create an instance and authenticate first. The following describes the typical path you need to take to do so.

### Create Instance
Credentials to use an IBM Push Notifications service are obtained via IBM Cloud. You will need an active account and a service instance for the service that you wish to use prior to authenticating in your application.

You can access the service credentials for your instance by taking the following steps:
1. Go to the [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com) page.
2. Either click an existing Push Notification service instance in your resource list or goto [Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog) -> Search for Push Notifications -> fill the required information, select your plan and region and create a service instance
3. Click on the Service Credentials tab in the left navigation bar to get required credentials.


### Import
1. Import the `IBMPushNotifications` framework.


	```swift
	import IBMPushNotifications
	```
 >**Note**: For Syndicated use the `overrideServerHost` param of `PushNotifications` before initliazong the `PushNotifications` .  Eg: `PushNotifications.overrideServerHost = "https://syndicated.region.net"`


### Initialize
1. Initialize with details about your IBM Cloud Push Notifications service.

- Initialize with ApiKey
	```swift

    //Initialize PushNotifications
	let myPushNotifications = PushNotifications(pushApiKey:"your-push-service-apiKey", pushAppGuid: "your-push-service-app_guid", pushRegion: PushNotifications.Region.US_SOUTH)
	
	// GET AUTH TOKEN
	myPushNotifications?.getAuthToken(completionHandler: { (hasToken, tokenString) in
		if hasToken! {
			// Send push notifications
		}
	})
	```

- Initialize with AppSecret
	```swift
	let myPushNotifications = PushNotifications(pushRegion: PushNotifications.Region.US_SOUTH, pushAppGuid: "your-push-service-guid", pushAppSecret: "your-push-service-appSecret")
	```

## Usage

### Send Push notifications
1. Create a simple push notification that will broadcast to all devices.
	
	```swift
	let messageExample = Notification.Message(alert: "Testing IBMPushNotifications")
	let notificationExample = Notification(message: messageExample)
	```
2. Send the Push notification using the method:

	```swift
	myPushNotifications.send(notification: notificationExample) { (data, status, error) in
	  if error != nil {
	    print("Failed to send push notification. Error: \(error!)")
	  }
	}
	```
>**Note**: If you are using the APIKEY for Initialisation kindly call `getAuthToken()` , before sending any notification. This will add an Authorization header for the request.

To create a more selective push notification with specified settings that is only sent to certain devices either by `deviceIds` or `userIds` or by device platforms or based on tag-subscriptions, or to set GCM and APNs features - there are optional parameters that you can use in the corresponding initializers.

### Send Bulk push notifications

To send the bulk push notifications of the following,

```swift
myPushNotifications.sendBulk(notification: [notificationExample,notificationExample1,notificationExample2]) { (data, status, error) in
	if error != nil {
		print("Failed to send push notification. Error: \(error!)")
	}
}
```
### Notification options 

#### Target

In `Target`, you pass the following values:

  * **deviceIds** - Array of device IDs.
  * **userIds** - Array of user IDs.
  * **platforms** - Array of platforms.
  * **tagNames** - Array of tag names.

	```swift
	let targetExample = Notification.Target(deviceIds: ["device1","device2"],
	         userIds: ["userId1", "userId2"],
	         platforms: [TargetPlatform.Apple,TargetPlatform.Google,TargetPlatform.ChromeExtApp,
	TargetPlatform.WebChrome,TargetPlatform.webFirefox,TargetPlatform.WebSafari], tagNames: ["tag1", "tag2"])
	```
>**Note**: Do not use userIds, tagNames, platforms and deviceIds together.

#### Settings

Settings can contain any of the following types:

 * APNs
