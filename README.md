let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bluemix-pushnotifications-swift-sdk.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 1)

#### Build on Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get update // not required on Mac
swift build -Xcc -fblocks -Xlinker -rpath -Xlinker $(pwd)/.build/debug/
```

## Usage

Import the BluemixPushNotifications framework.

```swift
import BluemixPushNotifications
```

Initialize with details about your Bluemix Push Notifications service.

```swift
let myPushNotifications = PushNotifications(bluemixRegion: PushNotifications.Region.US_SOUTH, bluemixAppGuid: "your-bluemix-app-guid", bluemixAppSecret: "your-push-service-appSecret")
```

Create a simple push notification that will broadcast to all devices.
```swift
let messageExample = Notification.Message(alert: "Testing BluemixPushNotifications", url: nil)
let notificationExample = Notification(message: messageExample, target: nil, settings: nil)
```

Or create a more selective push notification with specified settings that only gets sent to certain devices either by deviceIds or by userIds of users that own the devices or by device platforms or based on tag-subscriptions
```swift
let gcmExample = Notification.Settings.Gcm(collapseKey: "collapseKey", delayWhileIdle: true, payload: "payload", priority: GcmPriority.DEFAULT, sound: "sound.mp3", timeToLive: 1.0)
let apnsExample = Notification.Settings.Apns(badge: 1, category: "category", iosActionKey: "iosActionKey", sound: "sound.mp3", type: ApnsType.DEFAULT, payload: ["key": "value"])
let targetExample = Notification.Target(deviceIds: ["device1", "device2"], userIds: ["userId1", "userId2"], platforms: [TargetPlatform.Apple, TargetPlatform.Google], tagNames: ["tag1", "tag2"])
let messageExample = Notification.Message(alert: "Testing BluemixPushNotifications", url: "url")

let notificationExample = Notification(message: messageExample, target: targetExample, apnsSettings: apnsExample, gcmSettings: gcmExample)
```

Finally, send the Push notification.

```swift
myPushNotifications.send(notification: notificationExample) { (error) in
  if error != nil {
    print("Failed to send push notification. Error: \(error!)")
  }
}
```
