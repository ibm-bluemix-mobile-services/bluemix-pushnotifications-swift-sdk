## Usage

Import the BluemixPushNotifications framework.

```swift
import BluemixPushNotifications
```

Initialize with details about your Bluemix Push Notifications service.

```swift
let myPushNotifications = PushNotifications(bluemixRegion: PushNotifications.Region.US_SOUTH, bluemixAppGuid: "your-bluemix-app-guid", bluemixAppSecret: "your-push-service-appSecret") 
```

Create a simple push notification that will broadcast to all devices using MessageBuilder.
```swift

let messageBuilder = MessageBuilder(build: {
    
    $0.alert = "Testing BluemixPushNotifications" // Mandatory to set as of now.
    $0.url =  "www.example.com" // Optional

})
let message = Notification.Message(messageBuilder: messageBuilder)

let notificationExample = Notification(message: message)

```

Or create a more selective push notification with specified settings that only gets sent to certain devices either by deviceIds or by userIds of users that own the devices or by device platforms or based on tag-subscriptions 


Use TargetBuilder for creating target.

** Note we should either provide deviceIds or userIds or platforms or tagNames.
Below code snippet uses platforms, same way you can do it for deviceIds(...) or userIds(...) or tagNames(...)
```swift

let targetBuilder = TargetBuilder(build: {
    
    $0.platforms = [TargetPlatform.Apple, TargetPlatform.Google,TargetPlatform.WebChrome,
     TargetPlatform.WebFirefox, TargetPlatform.WebSafari, TargetPlatform.AppextChrome, ]
    
})
let target = Notification.Target(targetBuilder: targetBuilder)
```
Use MessagBuilder for message.
```swift
let messageBuilder = MessageBuilder(build: {
    
    $0.alert = "alert" // Mandatory to set.
    $0.url =  "url"

})
let message = Notification.Message(messageBuilder: messageBuilder)

```

Use SettingBuilder to set all or required platform settings (Firefox, Apns , Gcm etc), below is sample code snippet.
```swift

let settingsBuilder = SettingsBuilder(build: {
    
    /* Use ApnsBuilder for construction. Many new attributes added as shown below.
    */
    $0.apns = Notification.Settings.Apns(apnsBuilder:ApnsBuilder(build: {
        
        $0.badge = 0
        $0.interactiveCategory = "interactiveCategory"
        $0.iosActionKey = "iosActionKey"
        $0.sound = "sound.wav"
        $0.type = ApnsType.DEFAULT
        $0.payload = ["key":"value"]
        $0.titleLocKey = "titleLocKey"
        $0.locKey = "locKey"
        $0.launchImage = "launchImage"
        $0.titleLocArgs = ["titleLocArgs"]
        $0.locArgs = ["locArgs"]
        $0.subtitle = "subtitle"
        $0.title = "title"
        $0.attachmentUrl = "attachmentUrl"

    }))

    /* Use GcmBuilder for construction. Many new attributes added out of which style
     * and lights attributes you need to construct. usage in shown below.
    */
    
    $0.gcm = Notification.Settings.Gcm(gcmBuilder:GcmBuilder(build: {
        
        $0.collapseKey = "collapseKey"
        $0.interactiveCategory = "interactiveCategory"
        $0.delayWhileIdle = true
        $0.payload = ["key":"value"]
        $0.priority = GcmPriority.DEFAULT
        $0.sound = "sound.wav"
        $0.timeToLive = 1.0
        $0.icon = "iconUrl"
        $0.sync = false
        $0.visibility = Visibility.PUBLIC
        $0.style = Notification.Settings.GcmStyle(gcmStyleBuilder:GcmStyleBuilder(build: { 
            
            $0.type = GcmStyleTypes.INBOX_NOTIFICATION
            $0.title = "Style Messages"
            $0.url = "url"
            $0.text = "text"
            $0.lines = ["line1"]
        })).jsonFormat
        $0.lights = Notification.Settings.GcmLights(gcmLightsBuilder: GcmLightsBuilder(build:{ 
            
            $0.ledArgb = GcmLED.BLACK
            $0.ledOnMs = 2
            $0.ledOffMs = 2
            
        })).jsonFormat
    }))
    
    // Safari (SafariBuilder). All the three settings needs to be set for Safari.
    
    $0.safari = Notification.Settings.Safari(safariBuilder:SafariBuilder(build: { 
        
        $0.title = "title"
        $0.urlArgs = ["urlArg1"]
        $0.action = "action"

    }))
    // Firfox (FirefoxBuilder)

    $0.firefox = Notification.Settings.Firefox(firefoxBuilder: FirefoxBuilder(build: { 
        
        $0.title = "title"
        $0.iconUrl = "iconurl"
        $0.timeToLive = 1.0
        $0.payload = ["key":"value"]
        
    }))

    /* ChromeAppExtension (ChromAppExtBuilder).
     * Note : You should provide valid icon url or else 
     * notification would not work for ChromeAppExtension.
     */
    $0.chromeAppExtension = Notification.Settings.ChromAppExtension(chromeAppExtBuilder:
    ChromAppExtBuilder(build: { 
        
        $0.collapseKey = "collapseKey"
        $0.delayWhileIdle = false
        $0.title = "title"
        $0.iconUrl = "iconUrl"
        $0.timeToLive = 1.0
        $0.payload = ["key":"value"]
        
    }))

    // Chorme (ChromeBuilder)
    $0.chrome = Notification.Settings.Chrome(chromeBuilder:ChromeBuilder(build: { 
        
        $0.title = "title"
        $0.iconUrl = "iconurl"
        $0.timeToLive = 1.0
        $0.payload = ["key":"value"]
        
    }))
    
}) 

let settings = Notification.Settings(settingsBuilder:settingsBuilder)

```
Use message , target and settings created above to create final notification using builder.

```swift
let notificationBuilder = NotificationBuilder(build: {
    
    $0.message = message
    $0.target = target
    $0.settings = settings
})
let notificationExample = Notification(notificationBuilder:notificationBuilder)
```

Finally, send the Push notification.

```swift
myPushNotifications.send(notification: notificationExample) { (error) in
  if error != nil {
    print("Failed to send push notification. Error: \(error!)")
  }
}
```
